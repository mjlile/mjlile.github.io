      <description>Dickie, one of my parent&amp;rsquo;s dog, was an adorable pomeranian (see below for evidence). I often got requests to send pictures of him when I would visit home. Unfortunately, that was only once in a while, so I stockpiled some videos of him. I was encouraged to make a website to share new videos of Dickie on a daily basis, loosely inspired by the Wordle craze.
The implementation is a bit wonky, but it works and it was fun to build.</description>
